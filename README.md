# PortScanner
This script is a multithreaded network scanner that performs host availability checks and TCP port scanning. It reads a list of IP addresses from a user-specified file, verifies whether each host is online, retrieves hostname and alias information, scans for open ports within a specified range, and then saves the results in a JSON file.
